Falcon's :class:`~falcon.testing.TestClient` mimics the behavior of real WSGI
servers (and the WSGI spec) by presenting the ``PATH_INFO`` CGI variable
already in the percent-decoded form. However, the client also used to
indiscriminately set the non-standard ``RAW_URI`` CGI variable to ``/``, which
made writing tests for apps :ref:`decoding raw URL path <raw_url_path_recipe>`
cumbersome. This has been fixed, and the raw path of a simulated request is now
preserved in ``RAW_URI``.
