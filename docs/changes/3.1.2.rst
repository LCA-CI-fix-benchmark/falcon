Changelog for Falcon 3.1.1
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor point release fixing a couple of high impact bugs,
as well as publishing binary wheels for the recently released CPython 3.12.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- Falcon is now supported (including binary wheels) on CPython 3.12.
  A couple of remaining stdlib deprecations from 3.11 and 3.12 will be
  addressed in Falcon 4.0.
- As with the previous release, Python 3.5 & 3.6 remain deprecated and
  will no longer be supported in Falcon 4.0.
- EOL Python 3.7 will no longer be actively supported in 4.0, but the framework
  should still continue to install from source. We may remove the support for
  3.7 altogether later in the 4.x series if we are faced with incompatible
  ecosystem changes in typing, Cython, etc.
